Example on how to build and deploy a Container Based Service in (Omnistrate)[https://www.omnistrate.com]

## Configuration Setup
Before using the make commands, you need to set up the following configuration files:

1. `.env` file:
   ```
   OMNISTRATE_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   ```

   Make sure to keep this file secure and never commit it to version control.
